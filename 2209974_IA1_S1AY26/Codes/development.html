      <h2>Personal Development – Twelve Pillars (Chapters 4–7)</h2>
  
      <article>
        <h3>Chapter 4 — Achieve Your Goals</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This chapter teaches that success requires clear, written goals. Mr. Davis explains to Michael that working hard isn’t enough — you must work toward specific targets. Goals create purpose, direction, and motivation. Writing goals down and reviewing them often helps break big dreams into manageable steps.</p>
        <p><strong>My Reflection:</strong> This chapter aligns strongly with my motto: “Stop dreaming and move towards it.” As a future software engineer, businessman, and investor, I must turn my vision into written goals. Becoming the best version of myself requires structure — weekly coding targets, financial goals, business milestones, and long-term planning. Goals turn my empire from an idea into a blueprint.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 5 — The Proper Use of Time</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Time is the most valuable resource. Everyone gets the same 24 hours, but successful people use it wisely. Mr. Davis teaches that wasted minutes become wasted years, and disciplined time management leads to a successful, fulfilled life. Priority is the key — focus on what matters most.</p>
        <p><strong>My Reflection:</strong> This chapter speaks directly to me. Balancing university, coding practice, and personal goals often feels overwhelming, and distractions steal precious hours. If time is money, then discipline is wealth. Managing my time properly will determine how fast I become the engineer and businessman I want to be. Every hour I invest in learning moves me closer to the future version of myself — the one I look up to.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 6 — Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The people around you shape your mindset, habits, and dreams. Negative, unmotivated people lower your standards, while ambitious, disciplined people elevate your potential. Mr. Davis emphasizes that your environment is one of the biggest influences on your success.</p>
        <p><strong>My Reflection:</strong> This chapter reminded me that to build my empire, I must choose my circle carefully. Being around people who don’t care about goals or self-growth slows me down. But when I surround myself with ambitious individuals — students, developers, entrepreneurs — my energy and focus increase. A strong vision needs a strong circle.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 7 — Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Success requires continuous learning. Mr. Davis explains that formal education is only the beginning. Reading, studying, and staying curious is what separates the average from the exceptional. The best leaders and achievers never stop expanding their knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>My Reflection:</strong> This chapter fits perfectly with my journey. Technology evolves fast, and as a future software engineer and entrepreneur, I can’t afford to stop learning. Reading books, improving my coding skills, studying business, and learning about investing will shape my success. A growing mind builds a growing life — and that mindset will help me create the empire I envision.</p>
