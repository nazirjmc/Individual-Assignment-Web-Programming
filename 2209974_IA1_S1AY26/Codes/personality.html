            <h3>My Top Three Traits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outgoing</strong> – I enjoy connecting with people and building relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Chill</strong> – I stay calm under pressure, which helps during stressful school periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Observant</strong> – I pay attention to details, especially when debugging code or studying people.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These traits help me in school because being outgoing makes it easier to ask for help and work in groups,
                being chill keeps me from panicking over deadlines, and being observant helps me spot patterns in problems,
                whether in code, business ideas, or people’s behaviour.

            <h3>My Own Hero: Myself</h3>
            <p>
                I don’t have a traditional hero like a celebrity or public figure. Instead, I see my future self as my hero.
                The version of me who stayed disciplined, learned consistently, took calculated risks, and built the empire I imagine
                – that’s who I look up to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking this way keeps me accountable. I can’t lie to my future self, and I know every choice I make now
                either moves me closer to that version of Nazir or further away.

            <h3>Personal Motto</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “Stop dreaming and move towards it.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This quote reminds me that ideas alone are not enough. Every dream needs consistent action,
                whether that’s practising code, reading, working out, or researching investment options.
